### Step 20: The Assignment Operator =





#### Exercise 1: Increment and Decrement Counter

Write a Java program using JShell to demonstrate the use of increment and decrement operations on a counter variable `count`. Follow these steps:

1.  Initialize `count` with 10.
2.  Increment `count` by 2 using the `++` operator.
3.  Decrement `count` by 3 using the `--` operator.
4.  Add 5 to `count` using the `+=` operator.
5.  Subtract 2 from `count` using the `-=` operator.

Solution

```
jshell> int count = 10;
count ==> 10

jshell> count++;
count ==> 11

jshell> count--;
count ==> 10

jshell> count += 5;
count ==> 15

jshell> count -= 2;
count ==> 13

jshell> count;
count ==> 13
```

Explanation

We first initialize `count` with the value 10. We then increment it by 2 using the `++` operator, which results in `count` being equal to 11. We then decrement it by 3 using the `--` operator, which results in `count` being equal to 10 again.

Next, we add 5 to `count` using the `+=` operator, which results in `count` being equal to 15. Finally, we subtract 2 from `count` using the `-=` operator, which results in `count` being equal to 13.

We print the value of `count` using the JShell prompt at the end, which confirms that the above operations were successful.


#### Exercise 2: Arithmetic Operations on a Variable Problem

Write a Java program using JShell to perform arithmetic operations on a variable num. Follow these steps:

1. Initialize num with 5. 
2. Multiply num by 3. 
3. Divide num by 2. 
4. Calculate the remainder of num when divided by 4. 

##### Solution

```
jshell> int num = 5; 
num ==> 5

jshell> num *= 3; 
num ==> 15

jshell> num /= 2; 
num ==> 7

jshell> num %= 4; 
num ==> 3

jshell> num; 
num ==> 3
```



### Step 21: Assignment Puzzles, and PMT-Challenge revisited



#### Exercise 1: Pre- and Post- Increment and Decrement with JShell

**Problem:**

Using JShell, create a variable called `count` and initialize it with the value `10`. Then, apply pre- and post-increment and pre- and post-decrement operators. Print the value of the `count` variable after each operation to observe the differences.

```
jshell> int count = 10
count ==> 10

jshell> ++count
$1 ==> 11

jshell> count
count ==> 11

jshell> count++
$2 ==> 11

jshell> count
count ==> 12

jshell> --count
$3 ==> 11

jshell> count

jshell> count--
$4 ==> 11

jshell> count
count ==> 10
```

#### Exercise 2: Compound Assignment Operators with JShell

**Problem:**

Using JShell, create a variable called `value` and initialize it with the value `8`. Apply various compound assignment operators on `value` and print its value after each operation.

**Solution:**

```
jshell> int value = 8
value ==> 8

jshell> value += 4
$1 ==> 12

jshell> value
value ==> 12

jshell> value -= 2
$2 ==> 10

jshell> value
value ==> 10

jshell> value *= 3
$3 ==> 30

jshell> value
value ==> 30

jshell> value /= 2
$4 ==> 15

jshell> value
value ==> 15

$5 ==> 3

jshell> value
value ==> 3
```




### Step 22: Some  `JShell`  Usage Tips

#### Exercise 1

#### Problem

Write a short program in JShell to calculate the area of a rectangle using the given length and width. Use JShell internal variables to store the results of your calculations. Finally, print the area of the rectangle.

##### Solution

1.  Open JShell by typing `jshell` in your command prompt or terminal.
2.  Enter the following commands one by one in JShell:

```
int length = 10
int width = 5
int area = length * width
System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: " + area)
```

3.  You should see the output: `Area of the rectangle: 50`

#### Exercise 2

#### Problem

Create a simple program in JShell to add two numbers and print their sum. Then, use JShell shortcuts to modify the previous input and calculate the sum of two different numbers.

##### Solution

1.  Open JShell by typing `jshell` in your command prompt or terminal.
2.  Enter the following commands one by one in JShell:

```
int num1 = 3
int num2 = 7
int sum = num1 + num2
System.out.println("Sum of the numbers: " + sum)
```

3.  You should see the output: `Sum of the numbers: 10`
4.  Now, use the up-arrow key to navigate back to the `int num1 = 3` line and modify the value of `num1`:

```
int num1 = 5
```

5.  Use the up-arrow key again to navigate back to the `int num2 = 7` line and modify the value of `num2`:

```
int num2 = 9
```

6.  Finally, use the up-arrow key to navigate back to the `int sum = num1 + num2` and `System.out.println("Sum of the numbers: " + sum)` lines to re-execute them.
7.  You should now see the output: `Sum of the numbers: 14`




### Step 23: Introducing Conditionals - the if



#### Exercise 1: Check if a Number is Even

**Problem**: Write a Java program using JShell that checks if a given number is even or odd. If the number is even, print "The number is even", otherwise print "The number is odd".

**Solution**:

```
int number = 10;

if (number % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("The number is even");
} else {
    System.out.println("The number is odd");
}
``` 

#### Exercise 2: Compare Two Numbers

**Problem**: Write a Java program using JShell that takes two integer values as input and compares them. If the first number is greater than the second number, print "The first number is greater than the second number". 

**Solution**:

```
int num1 = 15;
int num2 = 7;

if (num1 > num2) {
    System.out.println("The first number is greater than the second number");
```

a ==> 10

jshell> int b = 20;
b ==> 20

jshell> int c = 5;
c ==> 5

jshell> int d = 15;

   ...> }
The sum of a and b is greater than the sum of c and d.
```

#### Exercise 2: JShell Triangle Angle Check

#### Problem

1.  Start a JShell session if you haven't already.
2.  Declare three integer variables angle1, angle2, and angle3, and initialize them with any integer values.
3.  Write an if statement to check if the sum of angle1, angle2, and angle3 equals 180 degrees. If so, print that the angles can form a triangle; otherwise, print that the angles cannot form a triangle.

##### Solution

// Start JShell if not already open
$ jshell

// Declare and initialize three integer variables for the angles
jshell> int angle1 = 60;
angle1 ==> 60

jshell> int angle2 = 60;
angle2 ==> 60

jshell> int angle3 = 60;
angle3 ==> 60

// Write an if statement to check if the angles can form a triangle
jshell> if (angle1 + angle2 + angle3 == 180) {
   ...>     System.out.println("The angles can form a triangle.");
   ...> } else {
   ...>     System.out.println("The angles cannot form a triangle.");
   ...> }
The angles can form a triangle.
```






### Step 26: if Statement again
#### Exercise 1

**Problem Statement:**

Create a JShell script that assigns a value to an integer `x` and checks if `x` is equal to 10. If `x` is equal to 10, print "x is equal to 10" and "x is even". If `x` is not equal to 10, print "x is not equal to 10".

**Solution:**

```
jshell> int x = 10;
jshell> if (x == 10) {
   ...> System.out.println("x is equal to 10");
   ...> System.out.println("x is even");
   ...> } else {
   ...> System.out.println("x is not equal to 10");
   ...> }
   ```

#### Exercise 2

**Problem Statement:**

Create a JShell script that assigns a value to an integer `y` and checks if `y` is greater than 15. If `y` is greater than 15, print "y is greater than 15" and "y is a large number". If `y` is not greater than 15, print "y is not greater than 15".

**Solution:**

```
jshell> int y = 20;
jshell> if (y > 15) {
   ...> System.out.println("y is greater than 15");
   ...> System.out.println("y is a large number");
   ...> } else {

   ...> }
```


### Step 27: Introducing Loops: The  `for`  Statement
