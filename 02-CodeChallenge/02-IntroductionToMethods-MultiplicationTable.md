```
jshell> void printNumbers() {
   ...> for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
   ...> System.out.println(i);
   ...> }
   ...> }
   ```

3. Call the `printNumbers` method:
```
jshell> printNumbers();
1
2
3
4
5
```

4. Exit JShell using `/exit` command:

```



### Step 03: Editing A Method Definition (Jshell Tips)



#### Exercise 1: Editing A Method Definition in JShell

1.  Launch JShell.
2.  Define a method called `greet` that prints the message "Welcome to JShell!" to the console.
3.  Call the `greet` method.
4.  Edit the `greet` method to print "Hello, JShell!" to the console instead.
5.  Call the `greet` method again to verify that it has been updated.
6.  Exit JShell using the `/exit` command.

##### Solution

1.  Launch JShell.
    
2.  Define a method called `greet` that prints the message "Welcome to JShell!" to the console.
    

```
jshell> void greet() {
   ...>     System.out.println("Welcome to JShell!");
   ...> }
   ```

3.  Call the `greet` method.

```
jshell> greet();
Welcome to JShell!
```

4.  Edit the `greet` method to print "Hello, JShell!" to the console instead.

```
jshell> /edit greet
```

This will open the method definition in an external editor. Replace the line that prints "Welcome to JShell!" with the following line:

```
System.out.println("Hello, JShell!");
```

Save the changes and close the editor.

5.  Call the `greet` method again to verify that it has been updated.

```
jshell> greet();
Hello, JShell!
```

### Step 07:  _PMT-Challenge_  Revisited (And Some Puzzles)


#### Exercise 1: Printing a Multiplication Table with a Method in JShell

Write a void method called `printMultiplicationTable` that takes an integer `number` as a parameter and prints the multiplication table of that number up to 15. Call the `printMultiplicationTable` method with a number of your choice.

##### Solution:

1.  Launch JShell.
    
2.  Define a void method called `printMultiplicationTable` that takes an integer `number` as a parameter and prints the multiplication table of that number up to 15:
    
```
void printMultiplicationTable(int number) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 15; i++) {
            System.out.println(number + " x " + i + " = " + (number * i));
        }
    }
```
    
3.  Call the `printMultiplicationTable` method with a number of your choice:
    
```
jshell> printMultiplicationTable(5);
    5 x 1 = 5
    5 x 2 = 10
    5 x 3 = 15
    5 x 4 = 20
    5 x 5 = 25
    5 x 6 = 30
    5 x 7 = 35
    5 x 8 = 40
    5 x 9 = 45
    5 x 10 = 50
    5 x 11 = 55
    5 x 12 = 60
    5 x 13 = 65
    5 x 14 = 70
    5 x 15 = 75
 ```
    
4.  Exit JShell using the `/exit` command.
    

Note: In this example, the `printMultiplicationTable` method takes an integer `number` as a parameter and prints the multiplication table of that number up to 15 using a for loop. We call the `printMultiplicationTable` method with the integer value of 5.

5.  If the number is even, print it to the console using `System.out.println()`.
6.  Call the `printEvenNumber` method with the argument `10`.
7.  Call the `printEvenNumber` method again with the argument `20`.
8.  Exit JShell using the `/exit` command.

#### Solution

1.  Launch JShell.

   ...> }
   ```

4.  Within the loop, use an `if` statement to check if the current number is even.

```
jshell> void printEvenNumber(int number) {
   ...>     for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
   ...>         if (i % 2 == 0) {
   ...>         }
   ...>     }
   ...> }
   ```

5.  If the number is even, print it to the console using `System.out.println()`.

```
jshell> void printEvenNumber(int number) {
   ...>     for (int i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
   ...>         if (i % 2 == 0) {
   ...>             System.out.println(i);
   ...>         }
   ...>     }
   ...> }
   ```

6.  Call the `printEvenNumber` method with an integer parameter `10`.

```
jshell> printEvenNumber(10);
2

| Goodbye
```



### Step 09: Methods With Multiple Arguments

#### Exercise 1: Methods with Multiple Arguments in JShell

1.  Launch JShell.
2.  Define a method called `calculateSum` that takes in two `int` arguments and calculates and prints their sum.
3.  Define another method called `calculateAverage` that takes in three `double` arguments and calculates and prints their average.
4.  Call the `calculateSum` method with two `int` arguments.
5.  Call the `calculateAverage` method with three `double` arguments.
6.  Exit JShell using the `/exit` command.

##### Solution

1.  Launch JShell.
    
2.  Define a method called `calculateSum` that takes in two `int` arguments and calculates and prints their sum.
    

```
jshell> void calculateSum(int num1, int num2) {
   ...>     int sum = num1 + num2;
   ...>     System.out.println("The sum of " + num1 + " and " + num2 + " is " + sum);
   ...> }
   ```

3.  Define another method called `calculateAverage` that takes in three `double` arguments and calculates and prints their average.

```
jshell> void calculateAverage(double num1, double num2, double num3) {
   ...>     double avg = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3.0;
   ...>     System.out.println("The average of " + num1 + ", " + num2 + ", and " + num3 + " is " + avg);
   ...> }
   ```

4.  Call the `calculateSum` method with two `int` arguments.

```
jshell> calculateSum(5, 7);
The sum of 5 and 7 is 12
```

5.  Call the `calculateAverage` method with three `double` arguments.

```
jshell> calculateAverage(3.5, 6.8, 9.1);
The average of 3.5, 6.8, and 9.1 is 6.466666666666666
```

6.  Exit JShell using the `/exit` command.

```
jshell> /exit
|  Goodbye
```


#### Exercise 2

Problem: Write a method called `printMessage` that takes a string message and an integer count as parameters, and prints the message count times to the console. Then, call the `printMessage` method with a string message of your choice and an integer count of your choice.

Solution:

```
1. Launch JShell
2. Define a method called `printMessage` that takes a string message and an integer count as parameters, and prints the message count times to the console:
   jshell> void printMessage(String message, int count) {
              for (int i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
                  System.out.println(message);
              }
          }
3. Call the `printMessage` method with a string message of your choice and an integer count of your choice:
   jshell> printMessage("Hello, world!", 3)
   Hello, world!
   Hello, world!
   Hello, world!
4. Exit JShell using the `/exit` command.
```

Note: In this example, the `printMessage` method takes two parameters - a string message and an integer count. Inside the method, we use a for loop to print the message count times to the console. Finally, we call the `printMessage` method with the string message "Hello, world!" and the integer count 3.



### Step 10: Returning From A Method

#### Exercise 1

Write a method called `calculateSum` that takes two integer parameters and returns their sum. Then, call the `calculateSum` method with two integer arguments of your choice and print the result to the console.

Solution:

1.  Launch JShell.
2.  Define a method called `calculateSum` that takes two integer parameters and returns their sum:
    
```
jshell> int calculateSum(int a, int b) {
               return a + b;
           }
```
    
3.  Call the `calculateSum` method with two integer arguments of your choice and print the result to the console:
    
```
jshell> int result = calculateSum(5, 7);
           System.out.println(result); 
```
    Output: `12`
4.  Exit JShell using the `/exit` command.

Note: In this example, we define a method called `calculateSum` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`. Inside the method, we return the sum of `a` and `b`. Finally, we call the `calculateSum` method with two integer arguments `5` and `7` and store the result in a variable named `result`. Then we print the `result` variable to the console using the `System.out.println()` method.



#### Exercise 2

Write a method called `sumNumbers` that takes an integer `n` as a parameter and returns the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.

Solution:

1.  Launch JShell.
2.  Define a method called `sumNumbers` that takes an integer `n` as a parameter and returns the sum of the first `n` natural numbers:
    
```
jshell> int sumNumbers(int n) {
               int sum = 0;
               for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                   sum += i;
               }
               return sum;
           }
```
    
3.  Call the `sumNumbers` method with an integer `n` of your choice:
    
```
jshell> sumNumbers(10)
    $1 ==> 55
```
    
4.  Exit JShell using the `/exit` command.

Note: In this example, the `sumNumbers` method takes an integer `n` as a parameter and returns the sum of the first `n` natural numbers using a for loop. We call the `sumNumbers` method with an integer `n` of 10 and it returns the sum of the first 10 natural numbers, which is 55.
