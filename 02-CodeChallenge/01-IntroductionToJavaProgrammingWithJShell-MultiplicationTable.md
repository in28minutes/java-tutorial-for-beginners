### Step 20: The Assignment Operator =





#### Exercise 1: Increment and Decrement Counter

Write a Java program using JShell to demonstrate the use of increment and decrement operations on a counter variable `count`. Follow these steps:

1.  Initialize `count` with 10.
2.  Increment `count` by 2 using the `++` operator.
3.  Decrement `count` by 3 using the `--` operator.
4.  Add 5 to `count` using the `+=` operator.
5.  Subtract 2 from `count` using the `-=` operator.

Solution

```
jshell> int count = 10;
count ==> 10

jshell> count++;
count ==> 11

jshell> count--;
count ==> 10

jshell> count += 5;
count ==> 15

jshell> count -= 2;
count ==> 13

jshell> count;
count ==> 13
```

Explanation

We first initialize `count` with the value 10. We then increment it by 2 using the `++` operator, which results in `count` being equal to 11. We then decrement it by 3 using the `--` operator, which results in `count` being equal to 10 again.

Next, we add 5 to `count` using the `+=` operator, which results in `count` being equal to 15. Finally, we subtract 2 from `count` using the `-=` operator, which results in `count` being equal to 13.

We print the value of `count` using the JShell prompt at the end, which confirms that the above operations were successful.


#### Exercise 2: Arithmetic Operations on a Variable Problem

Write a Java program using JShell to perform arithmetic operations on a variable num. Follow these steps:

1. Initialize num with 5. 
2. Multiply num by 3. 
3. Divide num by 2. 
4. Calculate the remainder of num when divided by 4. 

##### Solution

```
jshell> int num = 5; 
num ==> 5

jshell> num *= 3; 
num ==> 15

jshell> num /= 2; 
num ==> 7

jshell> num %= 4; 
num ==> 3

jshell> num; 
num ==> 3
```



### Step 21: Assignment Puzzles, and PMT-Challenge revisited



#### Exercise 1: Pre- and Post- Increment and Decrement with JShell

**Problem:**

Using JShell, create a variable called `count` and initialize it with the value `10`. Then, apply pre- and post-increment and pre- and post-decrement operators. Print the value of the `count` variable after each operation to observe the differences.

jshell> count
count ==> 11

jshell> count++
$2 ==> 11

jshell> count
count ==> 12

jshell> --count

$4 ==> 11

jshell> count
count ==> 10
```

#### Exercise 2: Compound Assignment Operators with JShell

**Problem:**

Using JShell, create a variable called `value` and initialize it with the value `8`. Apply various compound assignment operators on `value` and print its value after each operation.

**Solution:**

```
jshell> int value = 8
value ==> 8

jshell> value += 4
$1 ==> 12

jshell> value
value ==> 12

jshell> value -= 2
$2 ==> 10

jshell> value
value ==> 10

jshell> value *= 3
$3 ==> 30

jshell> value
value ==> 30

jshell> value /= 2
$4 ==> 15

jshell> value
value ==> 15

jshell> value %= 4
$5 ==> 3

jshell> value
value ==> 3
```




### Step 22: Some  `JShell`  Usage Tips

#### Exercise 1

#### Problem

Write a short program in JShell to calculate the area of a rectangle using the given length and width. Use JShell internal variables to store the results of your calculations. Finally, print the area of the rectangle.

##### Solution

1.  Open JShell by typing `jshell` in your command prompt or terminal.
2.  Enter the following commands one by one in JShell:

```
int length = 10
int width = 5
int area = length * width
System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: " + area)
```

3.  You should see the output: `Area of the rectangle: 50`

#### Exercise 2

#### Problem

Create a simple program in JShell to add two numbers and print their sum. Then, use JShell shortcuts to modify the previous input and calculate the sum of two different numbers.

##### Solution

1.  Open JShell by typing `jshell` in your command prompt or terminal.
2.  Enter the following commands one by one in JShell:

```
int num1 = 3
int num2 = 7
int sum = num1 + num2
System.out.println("Sum of the numbers: " + sum)
```

3.  You should see the output: `Sum of the numbers: 10`
4.  Now, use the up-arrow key to navigate back to the `int num1 = 3` line and modify the value of `num1`:

```
int num1 = 5
```

5.  Use the up-arrow key again to navigate back to the `int num2 = 7` line and modify the value of `num2`:

```
int num2 = 9
```

6.  Finally, use the up-arrow key to navigate back to the `int sum = num1 + num2` and `System.out.println("Sum of the numbers: " + sum)` lines to re-execute them.
7.  You should now see the output: `Sum of the numbers: 14`




### Step 23: Introducing Conditionals - the if



#### Exercise 1: Introducing Conditionals - the if

1.  Launch JShell
2.  Set the variable `age` to `20`: `int age = 20;`
3.  Use an `if` statement to print out `"You are eligible to vote"` if `age` is greater than or equal to `18`
4.  Use another `if` statement to print out `"You are not eligible to vote"` if `age` is less than `18`
5.  Exit JShell using `/exit` command

##### Solution 1

1.  Launch JShell
2.  Set the variable `age` to `20`: 
```
int age = 20;
````
3.  Use an `if` statement to print out `"You are eligible to vote"` if `age` is greater than or equal to `18`:

```
jshell> if(age >= 18)
          System.out.println("You are eligible to vote");
You are eligible to vote
```

4.  Use another `if` statement to print out `"You are not eligible to vote"` if `age` is less than `18`:

```
jshell> if(age < 18)
          System.out.println("You are not eligible to vote");
```

5.  Exit JShell using `/exit` command:

```
jshell> /exit
|  Goodbye
```

#### Exercise 2: Introducing Conditionals - the if

1.  Launch JShell
2.  Set the variable `price1` to `10.50`: `double price1 = 10.50;`
3.  Set the variable `price2` to `9.99`: `double price2 = 9.99;`
4.  Use an `if` statement to print out `"Price 1 is greater than Price 2"` if `price1` is greater than `price2`
5.  Use another `if` statement to print out `"Price 2 is greater than Price 1"` if `price2` is greater than `price1`
6.  Exit JShell using `/exit` command

##### Solution 2

1.  Launch JShell
2.  Set the variable `price1` to `10.50`: 
```
double price1 = 10.50;
```
3.  Set the variable `price2` to `9.99`: 
```
double price2 = 9.99;
```
4.  Use an `if` statement to print out `"Price 1 is greater than Price 2"` if `price1` is greater than `price2`:

```
jshell> if(price1 > price2)
          System.out.println("Price 1 is greater than Price 2");
Price 1 is greater than Price 2
```

5.  Use another `if` statement to print out `"Price 2 is greater than Price 1"` if `price2` is greater than `price1`:

```
jshell> if(price2 > price1)
          System.out.println("Price 2 is greater than Price 1");
```

6.  Exit JShell using `/exit` command:

```

**Solution:**

```
jshell> int x = 10;
jshell> if (x == 10) {
   ...> System.out.println("x is equal to 10");
   ...> System.out.println("x is even");

   ...> }
   ```

#### Exercise 2

**Problem Statement:**

Create a JShell script that assigns a value to an integer `y` and checks if `y` is greater than 15. If `y` is greater than 15, print "y is greater than 15" and "y is a large number". If `y` is not greater than 15, print "y is not greater than 15".

**Solution:**

```
jshell> int y = 20;
jshell> if (y > 15) {
   ...> System.out.println("y is greater than 15");

jshell> for (int i = 1; i <= 15; i++) {
...>     sum += i;
...> }
jshell> System.out.println("Sum of first 15 natural numbers: " + sum);
```

**Output:**

// Iterate through the first 10 even numbers
for (int i = 2; i <= 20; i += 2) {
    // Add the current even number to the sum
    sum += i;
}

// Print the sum
System.out.println("The sum of the first 10 even numbers is: " + sum);
```

#### Exercise 2: Calculate the factorial of a number using JShell

**Problem:**

Using JShell, write a program to calculate the factorial of a number (n). For this exercise, let n = 5.

**Solution:**

##### Solution 1

1.  Launch JShell
