## Extra on Step 13


**Question 23:** What is a constructor in Java? 
- a) A special method with the same name as the class 
- b) A method that returns a value 
- c) A method that can be called directly 
- d) A method that can only accept zero arguments

**Answer:** A constructor in Java is a special method with the same name as the class, used to initialize objects of that class.
Answer: a) A special method with the same name as the class

----------

**Question 24:** How is a constructor invoked in Java? 
- a) By calling the method directly 
- b) By using the new keyword while creating an object of the class 
- c) By declaring the constructor as static 
- d) By using the this keyword while creating an object of the class

**Answer:** A constructor in Java is invoked by using the new keyword while creating an object of the class.
Answer: b) By using the new keyword while creating an object of the class

----------

**Question 25:** Can a constructor accept multiple arguments in Java? 
- a) No, a constructor can only accept zero or one argument 
- b) Yes, a constructor can accept multiple arguments 
- c) Only the default constructor can accept multiple arguments 
- d) It depends on the access modifiers of the constructor

**Answer:** Yes, a constructor can accept multiple arguments in Java.
Answer: b) Yes, a constructor can accept multiple arguments


----------

**Question 26:** What is a default constructor in Java?
- a) A constructor that accepts no arguments 
- b) A constructor that is defined by the programmer 
- c) A constructor that is generated by the compiler when no constructor is defined 
- d) A constructor that is called automatically when an object is created

**Answer:** A default constructor in Java is a constructor that is generated by the compiler when no constructor is defined explicitly. It accepts no arguments and initializes the instance variables with their default values.
Answer: c) A constructor that is generated by the compiler when no constructor is defined

----------

**Question 27:** What happens when a class has no constructor defined in Java?- a) The code fails to compile 
b) A default constructor is generated by the compiler 
c) The code compiles and runs without any issues 
d) The class cannot be instantiated

**Answer:** If a class has no constructor defined in Java, the compiler generates a default constructor that accepts no arguments. If the class explicitly defines a constructor, the compiler does not provide a default constructor.

Answer: b) A default constructor is generated by the compiler. However, if a class has a constructor defined by the programmer, the compiler will not add a default constructor unless it is explicitly defined by the programmer.
