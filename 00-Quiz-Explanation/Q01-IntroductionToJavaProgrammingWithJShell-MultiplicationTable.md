  - `Incorrect: The variable x is incremented by 3, so its new value is 8, not 5.`

**Question 60: What is the result of the following code: int y = 10; y = y - 2; y = y - 3;**
- A) 3
  - `Incorrect: The variable y is decremented by 2 and then by 3, resulting in a value of 5, not 3.`
- B) 10
  - `Incorrect: The variable y is decremented by 2 and then by 3, resulting in a value of 5, not 10.`
- C) 5
  - `Correct: The variable y is decremented by 2 and then by 3, resulting in a value of 5.`

**Question 61: What is the difference between prefix and postfix versions of increment and decrement operators?**
- A) There is no difference between prefix and postfix versions.
  - `Incorrect: There is indeed a difference: the prefix version updates the variable first and then returns the value, while the postfix version first returns the value and then updates it.`
- B) Prefix version returns the updated value while postfix returns the original value.
  -

 `Correct: The prefix version increments or decrements the variable first and then returns the value, while the postfix version first returns the value and then increments or decrements it.`
- C) Postfix version returns the updated value while prefix returns the original value.
  - `Incorrect: This is the opposite of how prefix and postfix operators work in Java.`

**Question 62: What is the compound assignment operator used for?**
- A) To assign a new value to a variable.
  - `Incorrect: Although compound assignment does involve assigning a value to a variable, its main purpose is to simplify the syntax when the variable itself is part of the operation.`
- B) To combine the = with a numeric operator.
  - `Correct: Compound assignment operators combine the assignment operator (=) with a numeric operator such as +, -, *, or /.`
- C) To compare two values.
  - `Incorrect: Compound assignment operators are not used for comparison.`

**Question 63: What does the expression i %= 2 mean?**
- A) Add 2 to the value of i and store the result back into i.
  - `Incorrect: This would be represented by the expression i += 2, not i %= 2.`
- B) Divide i by 2, and store the result back into i.
  - `Incorrect: This would be represented by the expression i /= 2, not i %= 2.`
- C) Divide i by 2, and store the remainder back into i.
  - `Correct: The %= operator performs modulus division, dividing i by 2 and storing the remainder back into i.`


**Question 64: Which is the correct comparison operator in Java?**
- A) =
  - `Incorrect: = is the assignment operator in Java, not the comparison operator.`
- B) ==
  - `Correct: == is the comparison operator in Java, which checks if two variables are equal.`

**Question 65: What is the structure of an if statement in Java?**
- A) if {condition} (statement);
  - `Incorrect: Brackets are incorrectly placed in this statement. The condition should be inside parentheses and the statement inside braces.`
- B) if {statement} (condition);
  - `Incorrect: Brackets are incorrectly placed in this statement. The condition should be inside parentheses and the statement inside braces.`
- C) if (condition) {statement};
  - `Correct: This is the correct syntax for an if statement in Java.`

**Question 66: What is the output of the following code:**
```java
int a = 5;
int b = 10;
if (a > b) {
  System.out.println("a is greater than b");
} else {
  System.out.println("b is greater than a");
}
```
- A) a is greater than b
  - `Incorrect: The condition checks if a is greater than b, which is false as 5 is not greater than 10.`
- B) b is greater than a
  - `Correct: Since a is not greater than b, the else statement is executed, printing "b is greater than a".`

**Question 67: What is the output of the following code snippet?**
```java
int x = 7;
if (x < 10) {
    System.out.println("x is less than 10");
}
else {
    System.out.println("x is greater than or equal to 10");
}
```
- A) x is less than 10
  - `Correct: The variable x is less than 10, so this statement is printed.`
- B) x is greater than or equal to 10
  - `Incorrect: The variable x is less than 10, so this statement is not printed.`
- C) Compiler Error
  - `Incorrect: There is no compiler error. The code is correct.`

**Question 68: What happens when we don't use statement blocks with if conditional?**
- A) The condition statement only controls the execution of the first statement.
  - `Correct: If no braces are used, an if condition only applies to the immediate statement following it.`
- B) The condition statement controls the execution of all the statements.
  - `Incorrect: Without braces, only the immediate following statement is controlled by the if condition.`
- C) The code will not compile.
  - `Incorrect: The code will compile. It's just that the if condition will only apply to the immediate next statement.`

**Question 69: What is the benefit of using statement blocks with if conditionals?**
- A) Improves code readability
  - `Correct: Using braces makes it clear which statements are controlled by the if condition, improving readability.`
- B) Increases the number of statements that can be executed conditionally
  - `Incorrect: While using braces does allow multiple statements to be executed under a condition, the primary benefit is improving readability, not increasing functionality.`
- C) Improves program efficiency
  - `Incorrect: Using braces does not improve program efficiency. Its primary benefit is improving readability.`

**Question 70: What does a for loop iterate over?**
- A) a fixed number of iterations
  - `Incorrect: A for loop can iterate over a

 variable number of iterations, not just a fixed number.`
- B) an infinite number of times
  - `Incorrect: A for loop can run an infinite number of times only if its condition never becomes false, but generally it iterates over a variable number of times.`
- C) a variable number of times 
  - `Correct: A for loop can iterate over a variable number of times, depending on its condition.`

**Question 71: What is the syntax of a for loop?**
- A) for (initialization; update; condition)
  - `Incorrect: This is not the correct syntax for a for loop in Java. The correct order is: initialization; condition; update.`
- B) for (update; condition; initialization)
  - `Incorrect: This is not the correct syntax for a for loop in Java. The correct order is: initialization; condition; update.`
- C) for (initialization; condition; update)
  - `Correct: This is the correct syntax for a for loop in Java.`

**Question 72: What is the output of the following code snippet?**
```java
for (int i=0; i<=10; i++) {
    System.out.printf("%d * %d = %d", 6, i, 6*i).println();
}
```
- A) Multiplication table of 6
  - `Correct: This code prints the multiplication table of 6.`
- B) Multiplication table of 10
  - `Incorrect: The loop is multiplying by 6, not 10.`
- C) Multiplication table of 7
  - `Incorrect: The loop is multiplying by 6, not 7.`

**Question 73: What is the output of the following code snippet?**
```java
for (int i=1; i<=10; i++) {
    System.out.printf(i*i).println();
}
```
- A) The squares of integers from 1 to 10
  - `Correct: The code calculates and prints the squares of the integers from 1 to 10.`
- B) The squares of first 10 even integers
  - `Incorrect: The code calculates the squares of all integers from 1 to 10, not just the even ones.`
- C) The squares of first 10 odd integers
  - `Incorrect: The code calculates the squares of all integers from 1 to 10, not just the odd ones.`

```java
for (int i=10; i>0; i--) {
    System.out.printf(i).println();
}
```
- A) The integers from 10 to 1
  - `Correct: The code prints the integers from 10 to 1 in descending order.`
- B) The integers from 1 to 10
  - `Incorrect: The loop is set to decrement, not increment, so it prints from 10 to 1, not 1 to 10.`
- C) The squares of integers from 1 to 10 in reverse order
  - `Incorrect: The loop simply prints the numbers from 10 to 1, it does not square the numbers.`

**Question 75: Which of the following is true about the for loop construct in Java?**
- A) All components of the for loop are required.
  - `Incorrect: All components of the for loop (initialization, condition, and update) are optional in Java.`
- B) Only the condition component of the for loop is optional.
  - `Incorrect: All components of the for loop are optional in Java, not just the condition.`
- C) All components of the for loop are optional.
  - `Correct: In a Java for loop, all components are optional.`

**Question 76: What happens if the condition component of a for loop is left empty?**
- A) The loop continues indefinitely until stopped externally.
  - `Correct: If the condition component of a for loop is left empty, the

 loop will continue indefinitely (or until an external condition, like a `break` statement, stops it).`
- B) The loop exits immediately without executing any statements.
  - `Incorrect: The loop will continue to execute, not exit, if the condition is left empty.`
- C) The loop executes once and exits immediately.
  - `Incorrect: The loop will continue to execute indefinitely, not just once, if the condition is left empty.`

**Question 77: What is the output of the following code snippet?**
```java
int i = 1;
for (; i <= 10; i++);
System.out.println(i);
```
- A) 1
  - `Incorrect: The variable i is incremented in the for loop until it is not less than or equal to 10, so the output will be 11.`
