### Question 28

What is the if statement used for in Java?

-   a) To execute some code when a boolean condition is true. `Correct: An if statement in Java is used to execute a block of code when a specified condition is true`.
-   b) To execute some code when a boolean condition is false. `Incorrect: This is not the primary purpose of the if statement. Though an "else" clause following an if statement can execute code when the condition is false, the primary purpose of the if statement is to execute code when a condition is true`.
-   c) To execute some code regardless of the boolean condition. `Incorrect: An if statement is condition-dependent. Code within its block is executed only when the condition is true`【50†source】.

### Question 29

What is the difference between if and if-else statements in Java?

-   a) There is no difference, they do the same thing. `Incorrect: There is a difference between if and if-else statements. The if-else statement includes a default action when the if condition is false`.
-   b) If statement executes code only when the condition is true, whereas if-else statement executes code when the condition is false. `Correct: An if statement executes code only when its condition is true. An if-else statement adds a default action that is executed when the if condition is false`.
-   c) If statement executes code only when the condition is false, whereas if-else statement executes code when the condition is true. `Incorrect: This is the opposite of how if and if-else statements work in Java`【51†source】.

### Question 30

What is the output of the following code snippet in Java?

```java
int i = 10;
if(i < 5) {
    System.out.println("i is less than 5");
} else if(i > 20) {
    System.out.println("i is greater than 20");
} else {
    System.out.println("i is between 5 and 20");
}
```

-   a) "i is less than 5" `Incorrect: The value of i is 10, which is not less than 5`.
-   b) "i is greater than 20" `Incorrect: The value of i is 10, which is not greater than 20`.

### Question 31

What is the purpose of the if-else if-else statement in Java?

-   a) To execute some code when a boolean condition is true. `Incorrect: This is a feature of the if statement, not specifically the if-else if-else statement`.
-   b) To execute some code when multiple conditions are true. `Incorrect: An if-else if-else statement is used to check multiple conditions, but it only executes the first block of code whose condition is true`.
-   c) To execute some code when one and only one condition is true. `Correct: In an if-else if-else statement, once a true condition is found and its corresponding code block is executed, the remaining conditions are not checked`【53†source】.

### Question 32

What happens if multiple conditions in the if-else if-else statement evaluate to true in Java?

-   a) All corresponding code blocks are executed. `Incorrect: Only the first block of code with a true condition is executed in an if-else if-else statement`.
-   b) Only the first corresponding code block is executed. `Correct: In an if-else if-else statement, once a true condition is found and its corresponding code block is executed, the remaining conditions are not checked`.
-   c) Only the last corresponding code block is executed. `Incorrect: Only the first block of code with a true condition is executed in an if-else if-else statement`【54†source】.

### Question 33

    System.out.println("i is greater than 20");
} else if(i < 10) {
    System.out.println("i is less than 10");
} else {
    System.out.println("i is between 10 and 20");
}
```

        System.out.println(4);
    }
}
```

-   a) 1 `Incorrect: The value of k is 15, which is not greater than 20`.
-   b) 2 `Correct: The value of k is 15, which is greater than 10`.
-   c) 3 `Incorrect: The value of k is 15, which is less than 20, but the previous condition (k > 10) was already met and its block was executed`.
-   d) 4 `Incorrect: The else block would only execute if none of the previous conditions were met, but the condition (k > 10) was met`【56†source】.

### Question 35

What is the output of the following code snippet?

```java
public static void puzzleTwo() {
    int l = 15;

    if(l > 20)
    System.out.println("l > 20");
    else
    System.out.println("Who Am I?");
}
```

-   a) l < 20 `Incorrect: While it's true that l < 20, the subsequent else clause is associated with the second if statement (l > 20), not the first one`.
-   b) l > 20 `Incorrect: The value of l is 15, which is not greater than 20`.
-   c) Who Am I? `Correct: The else clause is associated with the second if statement, and since l is not greater than 20, "Who Am I?" is printed`【57†source】.

    System.out.println("m >  20");	else
    System.out.println("Who Am I?");
}
```

-   a) m > 20 `Incorrect: The outer condition (m > 20) is not met, so none of the code inside the outer if statement is executed`.
-   b) Who Am I? `Incorrect: The outer condition (m > 20) is not met, so none of the code inside the outer if statement is executed`.
-   c) Nothing is printed. `Correct: The outer condition (m > 20) is not met, so none of the code inside the outer if statement is executed`【58†source】.


### Question 37

```java
int i = 0;
if(i) {
    System.out.println("i");
}
```

### Question 51

What type of conditions can be evaluated using an if-family conditional?

-   a. Only boolean conditions `Correct: if, else if, and else in Java evaluate boolean conditions. They run or skip code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.`
-   b. Only integer values `Incorrect: While integer values can be part of a condition, the condition itself is evaluated as a boolean.`
-   c. Both boolean and integer values `Incorrect: The conditions are always evaluated as booleans, although they can compare integer values.`
-   d. None of the above `Incorrect: Option a is the correct one.`【73†source】

### Question 52

What is the advantage of using a switch conditional over an if-family conditional?

-   a. More readable and compact `Correct: Switch cases can be more readable and compact when comparing a variable to several constant values.`
-   b. Can be used to check for only integer values `Incorrect: Switch cases can also handle characters and enumerated types, not only integers.`
